# Comprehensive Analysis of UAE's Electricity Generation Capacity Growth (2010-2023)

## Overview
This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of the electricity generation capacity in the UAE from 2010 to 2023 for various authorities such as ADWEA, DEWA, SEWA, and FEWA. The goal is to fill a critical data gap and support stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding energy policy and investments.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uae-electricity-generation-analysis.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd uae-electricity-generation-analysis
   
3. Install the required Python packages:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   

## Usage
1. Ensure that the CSV file 'electricity-generation-plants-installed-capacity-by-authority-2010-2023.csv' is in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script to visualize the trends:
   bash
   python analyze_capacity.py
   

## Understanding the Output
- The script will generate a plot showing the electricity generation capacity trends from 2010 to 2023 for each authority in the UAE.
- The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis represents the capacity in megawatts (MW).
- Different lines will represent different authorities, allowing for a comparative analysis.
